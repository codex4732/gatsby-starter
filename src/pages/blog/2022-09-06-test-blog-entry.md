This is a test of a blog entry to see how netlify works with gatsby. 



Every time that I use this keyboard it makes me feel like I want to type for hours faster and faster. I have to say that before getting this mechanical keyboard, I was still typing using three fingers. Now this was not slow by any means, but, I always knew that I could type faster by using the proper method of typing. 



Fast forward a couple of months later; I now touch type on a mechanical keyboard. Meaning now my speeds are now in the 100 range. How nice. 



Though there is still time for improvement. 



Peace out !
